I am CTO at [miro](https://miro.io) where I work on Computer Vision and Machine Learning. (And writing web apps, because everything involves writing webapps)

Technical Interests
-------------------

 * Devops, specifically playing with [serverless](https://serverless.com) on AWS Lambda and deploying stuff to the cloud using Docker.
 * Machine Learning, training up my own classifier models using tensorflow and MXNet
 * Way too much Javascript, my OTF of right now being [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)  - and of course there's no escape from node.js

Other Interests
---------------
 * Running
 * Paddling
 * Brewing Beer
