Taylor and I gave a talk about how we used a Machine Learning approach to solve our problem of finding runners in race photos.

Watch the video on (youtube)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMDoHw4U53M]

We discuss how we tried to solve the problem using a traditional CV approach - HAAR classifiers with OpenCV, and after several months of pain built up good data to start training our own [SSD CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325). 

Check out the video to hear about how we got on, what was easy, what was hard, and why you can stuff a SSD512 model in a single lambda execution unit; but probably you shouldn't.
